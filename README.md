In this project, we'll be working with multiclass image classification with deep learning. The deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras will be implemented on clothing dataset to classify images of t-shirts.

The dataset has 5000 images of 20 different classes, however, we'll be using the subset which contains 10 of the most popular classes. The dataset can be downloaded from the link below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/clothing-dataset-small.git
```
If you have problems cloning the repository with the data, use a different command for cloning

During this project, we will walk through this plan.
